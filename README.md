# LangChain Testdrive

In this repository I am working through LangChains by going through the samples presented in the well written book from Mehul Gupta - LangChain in your Pocket.

The code in the book is not up to date with the current changes at LangChain and OpenAI. So the code in the repp was working for me in Qpril 2024 on a MacBook Pro M1.

## Tutorial1.py: OpenAI - Hello World

## Tutorial2.py: OpenAI - Use Prompting

## Tutorial3.py: Local LLM - Load an LLM from HuggingFace

## Tutorial4.py: Local LLM2 - Run a larger LLM from HuggingFace

## Tutorial5.py: OpenAI - Build a Custom Chain using LCEL
